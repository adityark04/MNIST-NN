# MNIST-NN
This project is a complete implementation of a Neural Network built from scratch using only the NumPy library. The goal of this network is to recognize handwritten digits (from 0 to 9) based on the well-known MNIST dataset. All the code for data handling, model training, and evaluation is contained within the NN.ipynb Jupyter Notebook.
